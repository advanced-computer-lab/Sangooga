# Sangooga Flight Reservation System

## Motivation

We created Sangooga to simulate working on a large scale web project using MERN stack. We focused on essential ideas that can be ported over to any other project.

## Build Status

- The website is almost ready for deployment, all essential backend routes are setup and the frontend is almost in shipping condition. Some frontend adjustments are still in progress though.
- There are no major bugs or glitches, if you find any while using the website, please reach out and let us know. 

## Code Style

- To maintain a convention and to increase code readibility, out entire team uses a well known VS extension called ["Prettier"](https://prettier.io/).
- Throughout the project all out variable nams are in camelCase.
